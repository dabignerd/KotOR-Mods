v1.1

- Fixed typo. It bothered me.
- Updated readme for clarification.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2

- Reduced the length of the blade to match the original better. Thanks to
  Mephiles550 for pointing that out.
- Adjusted the hilt position. I initially placed it to female hands and male
  hands would clip through the guard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.3

- Updated blade textures using the After Effects plug-in Saber.
- Rotated the hilt to match the way it is held in the TV shows. Thanks to
  JustABitAgroed for pointing that out.

- Converted all textures to compressed TPC format.
- Changed installation to TSLPatcher format.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.4

- Fixed an issue with the Darksaber being equipped by the NPC meant to drop it,
  but not dropped. Thanks to Rathic for pointing out this oversight.
- Adjusted installer to patch .mod file instead of installing to Override where
  applicable.
