================================================================================
1.  SUMMARY
================================================================================

This mod adds the Darksaber, a unique lightsaber seen in the Clone Wars and
Rebels TV shows, to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.

The Darksaber comes with a custom hilt and blade effect.

The Darksaber's stats are better than the standard lightsaber's (+2 Charisma and
+1d8 Universal damage) but the item cannot be upgraded.

I have integrated the item into the game, but I'll keep the how a surprise. One
hint: You will have to complete a side quest that involves Mandalorians.

If you want to get it through playing the game, you'll have to start a new game.
Otherwise, you can cheat it in. The item is "jc_darksaber".



================================================================================
2.  INSTALLATION
================================================================================

1. Extract files from the downloaded archive.
2. Run Darksaber_K1.exe.
3. Click "Install Mod" and select your game directory (default name SWKOTOR).



================================================================================
3.  UNINSTALLATION
================================================================================

1. Remove the installed files or replace from backups if necessary.



================================================================================
4.  COMPATIBILITY
================================================================================

Compatibility with other lightsaber mods not guaranteed.

This mod uses lightsaber model variation 255.

This mod patches the module kas_m25aa in order to place the Darksaber into the
game. If you have any compatibility issues with other mods that edit this area,
you can cheat the item into the game instead. The Darksaber item is
"jc_darksaber".
