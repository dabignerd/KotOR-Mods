~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
» DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WARNING: IN ALMOST ALL CASES, IT IS RECOMMENDED TO INSTALL THE K1R RESTORATION BEFORE ANY OTHER MODS!!! THE ONLY EXCEPTION SO FAR IS KAINZORUS PRIME'S NPC OVERHAUL...

The KotOR 1 Restoration Mod is an attempt to restore almost all the content that was cut from the game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic by BioWare Corp. Of course, these restorations will be within reason and things that were cut because they did not fit with the plot, and cannot be made to fit with the plot, will most definitley NOT be restored.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
» INTEGRATED MODS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With permission, the following mods (or group of fixes) have been included in K1R 1.2:

- Salk's Dialogue Fixes 2.0 (Fixes various typos in the English version of the game)
- Kainzorus Prime's Korriban and Manaan Music Fixes (correct music now plays)
- Red Hessian's Desert Wraid and Shyrack Texture Fix (proper textures)
- Kexikus' Manaan Quest Endings
- Kexikus' Fixed Shields (Shields now block the proper damage types)
- danii-ch's KotOR Bug Fix Attempt 1.0 (Bastila Romance glitch, Calo's soundset, and tweaks/corrections to the Leviathan)
- All of the fixes from http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://shrines.rpgclassics.com/pc/kotorpc/900.shtml

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
» RESTORED CONTENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most of the content that can be restored has been. This includes content for literally every planet.

- Impossible Difficulty, a cut option for difficulty that is harder than the Vanilla "Hard" difficulty
- Carth dialogue when the PC first awakens on Taris, Carth makes a few comments about the PC's injuries. (Thanks to zbyl2 for this!)
- Numerous restorations to the Lower City
- Numerous restorations to the Under City
- Restoration of the Black Vulkar Base Sublevel
- Restored Droid Items
- Restoration of some dialgoue with Niklos in the Uppper City Cantina
- Restoration of the Duel Ring announcer in the Taris Upper City Cantina. The announcer will be available to speak to in between fights.
- Zaerdra Swoop Platform Dialogue, Zaerdra will make some final comments to the PC on the prototype accelerator before intitiating your first run with it
- Sith Base, numerous restorations
- Sarna and Yun Genda are available to talk to members of the same sex and can be used to further the plot of Taris. Albeit, in different ways than they normally do.
- Iriaz Restoration, returns the Iriaz to the plains of Dantooine. (Thanks to Seamhiann for this!)
- Garrum and Tar'eelok Restoration, returns a cut padawan and master to the Jedi Enclave. (Thanks to Seamhiann for this!)
- Restoration of cut items within the Jedi Enclave
- Shen and Rahashia Indecent Proposal, the PC can make a rather indecent, and awkward, proposal to either Shen or Rahasia depending upon the PC's gender.
- The file called plc_glowpudl.utp had the name of "Glowing Puddle" however when placed in game it looked like a blood puddle. The model file and textures have been changed so now the glowing puddle placeable makes a glowing puddle of green liquid. It can be seen in the new module, tar_m03ac, or the swoop platform non-racing version.
- Modified Iriaz from Seamhiann's modules so there were less of them, they fought against the Kath Hounds, and usually stayed in their small areas.
- Restored Crattis dialogue to sell lightsaber crystals.
- A swathe of Jawa-work on Tatooine.
- Restored dialogue with Bastila's Mother.
- Restored shape-shifting for Genoharadan Rulan on Kashyyk.
- Pazaak Tournament on Manaan.
- Restored Party Dialogue on Sea Floor.
- Alternate way into Sith Base on Manaan.
- Funny dialogue with bartender on Korriban.
- Alternate route on Leviathan.
- Goodies on Unknown World, including restored Injured Sith Apprentice.
- Restored Female Dark Side Ending.
- Restored the True Form of the Sith Armor Quest on Taris

» BUG FIXES/CHANGE LOG FOR 1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
»» Original game:
	» Taris:
	- Item Duplication exploit with Brejik's gear
	- Dueling exploit to get two of Bendak's Blaster
	- Zelka's assistant Gurney informs you about selling the serum after you've given it to Zelka

	» Dantooine:
	- Resolving the Sandral-Matale Feud peacefully would allow you to keep talking to Rahasia and restarting the 	cutscene
	- Wandering Jedi near the Ebon Hawk forgot to keep walking after they were done talking to you

	» Ebon Hawk:
	- Infinite DS exploit when you make Sasha leave the ship. Her leaving is now part of the dialog

	» Tatooine:
	- If you rescued Griff without Mission, Griff would meet you at your ship; Mission would have no clothes on

	» Kashyyyk:
	- Several bugs related to Bacca's Blade would prevent you from ever obtaining it

	- Bug in the Iridonian Mercenary's dialog would make it seem to freeze, requiring you to hit 1 or 2 to proceed
	- Elora would confess to Sunry's affair if Bastila or Jolee is present, but you wouldn't get any plot EXP from it
	- Bug in Ignus the hotel owner's dialog, preventing him from testifying for you if you Force Persuade him

	» Korriban:
	- Mismatched soundsets for the three Sith that attack you in the Valley of the Sith Lords
	- Blowing up the pillar in Ajunta Pall's Tomb; you could still interact with objects and permanently glitch out 	whicever party members are with you. Now changed to a dialog instead of an inventory
	- Having to fight your way out of the Sith Academy would not remove any prestige quests that you would never 	be able to turn in

	» The Leviathan:
	- Multiple camera angles and lack of gender checks during Saul's interrogation

	» Yavin Station:
	- Multiple dialog errors when the Trandoshans arrive, causing the dialog to break at several points

	» General stuff:
	- Bug during Xor's ambush that would prevent Ziagrom and any other messengers from ever spawning, locking 	you out of a unique store and the other party members' quests

	- Playing Pazaak with a mechanic in the Vulkar Base would not update the "Pazaak Rules" quest

	- Various issues related to Jolee's extra fight have been fixed; the entire scene was re-done differently

	» The Leviathan:
	- All doors involved in all of Major Hurka's cutscenes now close at the right times
	- Two guards now walk into the Medical Bay properly
	- Lip-sync corrections all-around with Major Hurka's content
	- Cutscenes for Major Hurka now play out only once and work properly in all (hopefully) conditions
	- If you use Major Hurka, you are now able to also see Canderous' comm message like you normally would have

» INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An installation which involves the TSL Patcher has been made ready for your use and is the simplest and easiest way to carry out installation.

Alternatively, a secondary installer has been made for convenience. It will not patch the files like the TSL Patcher will, but it should be less of a headache for most users. HOWEVER, IT WILL NEED TO BE INSTALLED BEFORE ANY OTHER MODS!!!

Note: The K1R team is not responsible for any incompatibility issues that may arise from the use of this mod in conjunction with other mods. Also, in order to provide the best feedback for us we recommend that you play K1R with NO other mods installed. 

Note 2: If using the TSL Patcher AND your game is in English, before installing, copy the dialog.tlk file bundled with this package into the KotOR directory. This will give you the grammar and typo fixes to the vanilla text.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
»»»» TSL PATCHER INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Double click K1R_1.2_Installer.exe found in the main directory of the unpacked folder.
2) Click the button labeled Install Mod.
3) Click yes to the box that'll pop up... if you wish to proceed with installation.
4) Watch as all the little file names and progress reports scroll by and wait until the installer is complete.
