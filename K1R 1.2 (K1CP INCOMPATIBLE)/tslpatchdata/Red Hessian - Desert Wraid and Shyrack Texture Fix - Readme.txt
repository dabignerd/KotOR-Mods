Desert Wraid & Shyrack Texture Fix




DESCRIPTION: This mod restores the previously unused textures for Desert Wraids and fixes the textures for Shyracks, Shyrack Raptors/Alphas and Shyrack Wyrms which were mixed up and not implemented correctly (i.e. most of them used the same texture variant).

INSTALLATION: Extract the UTC files to your Override folder. To uninstall simply delete the files from your Override folder. 
NOTE: In order for the mod to work you must load a save game from BEFORE you entered Tatooine's Dune Sea & Korriban's Valley of the Dark Lords. 

BUGS: None known.
